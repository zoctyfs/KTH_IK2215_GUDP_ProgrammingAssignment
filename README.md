# KTH_IK2215_GUDP_ProgrammingAssignment
This is a GUDP programming assignment for the KTH IK2215. It scored 4.5 out of 6 on the test.
There is always a problem with the Receiving thread, it does not pass the "Receive files from other senders" and all the demerits come from this.
Note that there are some stability issues with the file, and there is a chance that the first BSN packet will be sent incorrectly, but the probability is small.
